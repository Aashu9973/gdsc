            <p>The ASME Innovative Additive Manufacturing 3D Challenge is organized
                annually as part of E-fest by ASME. The competition is about how students
                showcase their creativity by demonstrating the value added through their
                ingenuity, application of sound engineering design principles, and Additive
                Manufacturing technologies. Every year this theme-based competition
                comes up with an innovative problem statement to give undergraduate
                students worldwide an opportunity to re-engineer existing products or
                create new designs. This year’s challenge was designing, testing, and
                manufacturing a “D.I.R.T.”-GBRCV (Design, Integration, Research, and Test
                – Ground-Based Remote Controlled Vehicle). Team Droid of ASME IIT
